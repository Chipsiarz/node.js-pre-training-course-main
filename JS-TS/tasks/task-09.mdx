## Task 9: Write Unit Tests for Business Logic

**Description:**  
Ensure reliability by writing comprehensive unit tests for `TodoService` and the repository.

**Requirements:**
1. Add Jest to the project (use `ts-jest` for TypeScript support).
2. Create `tests/todo-service.spec.ts` and cover at minimum:
   - successful creation of a todo  
   - toggling status  
   - search returns matching items  
   - error is thrown when updating non-existing id
3. Mock the network latency (`setTimeout`) to keep tests fast.
4. Achieve at least **90 %** line coverage for service and repository files.
