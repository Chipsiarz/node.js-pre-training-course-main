## Task 8: Compose Services with Dependency Injection

**Description:**  
Create a `TodoService` class that orchestrates business logic by consuming the `TodoApi`. Inject the dependency to keep the service testable and decoupled.

**Requirements:**
1. Implement `solutions/todo-service.ts` with a constructor that accepts an instance of `TodoApi`.
2. Expose high-level methods:
   - `create(title: string, description?: string): Promise<Todo>`
   - `toggleStatus(id: number): Promise<Todo>`
   - `search(keyword: string): Promise<Todo[]>` (search in title & description, case-insensitive).
3. Do **not** touch the storage layer directly; always delegate to `TodoApi`.
4. Add input validation and throw meaningful errors.
