# Task 03: Filtering and Sorting Todos with Raw SQL

In this task, you will use **raw SQL** to write queries that filter and sort data in the `todos` table. These operations are essential for displaying relevant tasks to users in a todo-list application.

## Step-by-step Instructions

1. **Filter by Status:**

   - Write a SQL query to select all todos with a specific status (for example, only 'active' todos).
   - Write a separate query to select all todos with the status 'completed'.

2. **Sort by Creation Date:**

   - Write a SQL query to select all todos, sorted by the `created_at` column in ascending order (oldest first).
   - Write another query to select all todos, sorted by the `created_at` column in descending order (newest first).

3. **Search by Keyword:**
   - Write a SQL query to select all todos where the `title` or `description` contains a specific keyword (for example, 'meeting').

## Document Your Work

After completing all previous steps, document your work in `solutions/task-03.sql`:

- Write down all terminal commands you used to interact with the database.
- Include all SQL queries you executed.
- Briefly describe what you did and any issues you encountered.
