# Task 02: Basic CRUD Operations on the "todos" Table with Raw SQL

In this task, you will use **raw SQL** (not an ORM or any abstraction) to practice the four basic database operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) on the `todos` table you created in Task 1.

## Step-by-step Instructions

1. **Create (Insert a new todo):**

   - Write a SQL statement to insert a new todo into the `todos` table.
   - Provide values for the `title`, `description`, and `status` columns.

2. **Read (Select todos):**

   - Write a SQL statement to select all todos from the table.
   - The result should include all columns.

3. **Update (Change the status of a todo):**

   - Write a SQL statement to update the `status` of a specific todo, identified by its `id`.

4. **Delete (Remove a todo):**
   - Write a SQL statement to delete a todo from the table, identified by its `id`.

## Document Your Work

After completing all previous steps, document your work in `solutions/task-02.sql`:

- Write down all terminal commands you used to interact with the database.
- Include all SQL queries you executed.
- Briefly describe what you did and any issues you encountered.
