# Task 05: Aggregation and Grouping in SQL (Raw SQL)

In this task, you will use **raw SQL** to write queries that aggregate and group data in your todo-list database. These operations are useful for generating statistics and summaries.

## Step-by-step Instructions

1. **Count Todos by Status:**

   - Write a SQL query to count the number of todos for each status (e.g., how many are 'active', how many are 'completed').

2. **Count Todos per User:**

   - Write a SQL query to count the number of todos for each user. The result should show the user's name (or email) and the count of their todos.

3. **Find Users with No Todos:**
   - Write a SQL query to find all users who do not have any todos assigned to them.

## Document Your Work

After completing all previous steps, document your work in `solutions/task-04.sql`:

- Write down all terminal commands you used to interact with the database.
- Include all SQL queries you executed.
- Briefly describe what you did and any issues you encountered.
