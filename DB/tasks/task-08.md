# Task 08: Implementing CRUD Operations with an ORM

In this task, you will use your chosen **ORM** to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the `todos` table in your todo-list project. This will help you understand how to interact with your database from your application code.

## Step-by-step Instructions

1. **Create a Todo:**

   - Write code using your ORM to create a new todo item in the database.
   - Provide values for the required fields (e.g., title, description, status, user reference).

2. **Read (List) Todos:**

   - Write code to retrieve all todos from the database.
   - Optionally, filter todos by status or by user.

3. **Update a Todo:**

   - Write code to update the status or other fields of a specific todo, identified by its ID.

4. **Delete a Todo:**
   - Write code to delete a todo from the database, identified by its ID.

## Document Your Work

After completing all previous steps, document your work in `solutions/task-08.sql`:

- Provide a link to the pull request where you implemented the solution, or list the relevant commit hashes if a pull request is not available.
- Briefly describe what you did and any issues you encountered.
