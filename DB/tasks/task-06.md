# Task 06: Indexes and Query Optimization (Raw SQL)

In this task, you will use **raw SQL** to improve the performance of your todo-list database by creating indexes and analyzing query execution.

## Step-by-step Instructions

1. **Create Indexes:**

   - Write a SQL statement to create an index on the `status` column in the `todos` table.

2. **Analyze Query Performance:**
   - Write a SQL statement using `EXPLAIN` (or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, depending on your database) to analyze the execution plan of a query that selects todos by `status`.

## Document Your Work

After completing all previous steps, document your work in `solutions/task-04.sql`:

- Write down all terminal commands you used to interact with the database.
- Include all SQL queries you executed.
- Briefly describe what you did and any issues you encountered.
