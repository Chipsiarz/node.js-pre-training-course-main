STEP 1: Database Connection
- Opened pgAdmin 4.
- Connected to the previously created PostgreSQL database "todo_app"
- Opened the Query Tool to execute raw SQL statements.

STEP 2: Create the users Table 
- I already have table from previous tasks

STEP 3: Alter the todos Table

ALTER TABLE todos
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_todos_user
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
ON DELETE CASCADE;

This links each todo to a specific user via a foreign key.
The ON DELETE CASCADE rule ensures that when a user is deleted, all their todos are deleted automatically.

STEP 4: Insert Example Data
- Insert sample users
INSERT INTO users (name, email, password_hash)
VALUES
('Alice Johnson', 'alice@example.com', 'hashed_password'),
('Bob Smith', 'bob@example.com', 'hashed_password');

- Insert todos linked to these users
INSERT INTO todos (title, description, status, user_id)
VALUES
('Finish SQL task', 'Complete task 04 in course', 'active', 3),
('Prepare meeting notes', 'Notes for Monday meeting', 'completed', 4);

This verifies that the foreign key works — both todos are tied to existing users.

STEP 5: Verify the Relationship
- View all todos with user info
SELECT t.id, t.title, t.status, u.name AS user_name, u.email
FROM todos t
JOIN users u ON t.user_id = u.id;

This confirms that todos are correctly linked to users.

STEP 6: Summary
- Established a foreign key relationship (todos.user_id → users.id).
- Verified that inserting todos with valid users works.
- No errors encountered.
