STEP 1: Database Connection
- Opened pgAdmin 4.
- Connected to the previously created PostgreSQL database "todo_app"
- Opened the Query Tool to execute raw SQL statements.


STEP 2: Creating an Index on the status Column
Indexes improve query performance by allowing the database to quickly locate rows based on indexed columns.
I created an index on the status column of the todos table as follows:

- Create an index to optimize queries filtering by status
CREATE INDEX idx_todos_status ON todos(status);

After executing this command, the database will maintain a separate index structure for the status column, which accelerates queries like:
SELECT * FROM todos WHERE status = 'active';


STEP 3: Analyzing Query Performance
Before and after creating the index, I used the EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN ANALYZE commands to analyze how PostgreSQL executes the query.

- Analyze how PostgreSQL executes the query:
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM todos WHERE status = 'active';


STEP 4: Verification

I ran both EXPLAIN ANALYZE queries before and after creating the index and observed the performance difference.
After adding the index, the query cost and execution time were significantly reduced.


STEP 5: Issues Encountered
Initially, I forgot to use ANALYZE after creating the index. Running:
ANALYZE todos;

helped PostgreSQL update its internal statistics for better optimization.
No major errors occurred during index creation.
