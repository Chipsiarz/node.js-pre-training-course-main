STEP 1: Database Connection
- Opened pgAdmin 4.
- Connected to the previously created PostgreSQL database "todo_app"
- Opened the Query Tool to execute raw SQL statements.

STEP 2: Preparation – Insert a User (Required for Foreign Key)
Before inserting any todo, we must have a valid user in the users table,
because the todos.user_id column references users.id.

- Insert a user that will own todos
INSERT INTO users (username, email, password_hash)
VALUES ('john_doe', 'john@example.com', 'hashed_password_123')

This successfully creates a new user with id = 2

STEP 3: CREATE – Insert a New Todo
- Create a new todo for user with ID = 1
INSERT INTO todos (title, description, status, user_id)
VALUES ('Learn SQL CRUD', 'Practice basic SQL operations', 'active', 2)

This successfully creates a new todo with id = 6, because the user with id = 2 exists

STEP 4: READ – Select All Todos
- Retrieve all todos
SELECT * FROM todos

Displays all records from the todos table with columns:
id, title, description, status, created_at, user_id.

STEP 5: UPDATE – Modify a Todo’s Status
- Update the status of a todo by ID
UPDATE todos
SET status = 'completed'
WHERE id = 6;

This marks the first todo as completed.

STEP 6: DELETE – Remove a Todo
- Delete a todo by ID
DELETE FROM todos
WHERE id = 6;

STEP 7: Verification Queries
- Check all todos after deletion
SELECT * FROM todos;

- Check all users
SELECT * FROM users;

STEP 8: Summary

- Practiced all four CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using raw SQL.

- Verified that foreign key relationships work correctly.

- Encountered and resolved the foreign key error by inserting a user first.

- Confirmed that data integrity between users and todos is maintained
