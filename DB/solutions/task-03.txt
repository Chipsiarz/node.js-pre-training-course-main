STEP 1: Database Connection
- Opened pgAdmin 4
- Connected to the database todo_app created in Task 1
- Opened the Query Tool

STEP 2: Insert Example Data (optional, for testing)
- Insert sample todos to test filtering and sorting

INSERT INTO todos (title, description, status, user_id)
VALUES
('Buy groceries', 'Get milk and eggs', 'active', 2),
('Finish project', 'Complete SQL assignment', 'completed', 2),
('Call John', 'Discuss meeting plans', 'active', 2),
('Team meeting', 'Prepare agenda for team meeting', 'completed', 2),
('Clean the house', 'Vacuum and dust living room', 'active', 2);

STEP 3: Filter by Status
- Select only active todos
SELECT * FROM todos
WHERE status = 'active';

- Select only completed todos
SELECT * FROM todos
WHERE status = 'completed';


These queries filter todos by their status value.

STEP 4: Sort by Creation Date
- Sort todos by oldest first (ascending order)
SELECT * FROM todos
ORDER BY created_at ASC;

- Sort todos by newest first (descending order)
SELECT * FROM todos
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

These queries show todos ordered by when they were created.

STEP 5: Search by Keyword
- Search for todos containing the word 'meeting' in title or description
SELECT * FROM todos
WHERE title ILIKE '%meeting%'
OR description ILIKE '%meeting%';


The ILIKE operator makes the search case-insensitive (works in PostgreSQL).

STEP 6: Verification Queries
- View all todos to confirm data
SELECT * FROM todos;

STEP 7: Summary
- Practiced filtering using WHERE.
- Practiced sorting with ORDER BY.
- Practiced searching using ILIKE and wildcards (%).
- Verified queries returned correct results.
- No major issues encountered.
