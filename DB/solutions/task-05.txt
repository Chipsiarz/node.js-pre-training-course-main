STEP 1: Database Connection
- Opened pgAdmin 4.
- Connected to the previously created PostgreSQL database "todo_app"
- Opened the Query Tool to execute raw SQL statements.


STEP 2: Counting Todos by Status
I wrote a query to count how many todos exist for each status (active, completed, etc.):

- Count todos grouped by status:
SELECT status, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM todos
GROUP BY status
ORDER BY count DESC;

This query groups all todos by their status and counts how many todos fall into each category


STEP 3: Counting Todos per User
I wrote a query to show how many todos belong to each user.
The result includes the user's name, email, and the total number of todos.

- Count todos per user (including users with zero todos)
SELECT u.id AS user_id,
       u.username AS user_name,
       u.email,
       COUNT(t.id) AS todo_count
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN todos t ON t.user_id = u.id
GROUP BY u.id, u.username, u.email
ORDER BY todo_count DESC;


The LEFT JOIN ensures that users without any todos still appear in the results (with a count of 0).

Sorting by todo_count DESC lists the most active users first.


STEP 4: Finding Users Without Any Todos
I wrote two different queries to identify users who have no todos assigned.

SELECT u.id, u.username, u.email, u.created_at
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN todos t ON t.user_id = u.id
WHERE t.id IS NULL;

Both queries return all users that do not have any associated rows in the todos table.


STEP 5: Summary
- All aggregation and grouping queries executed successfully.
I confirmed that:
- The database structure (users ↔ todos) works correctly.
- Grouping and filtering queries return accurate results.
- Users without todos can be detected properly.
