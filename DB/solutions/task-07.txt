STEP 1: ORM Installation
- Installed Prisma ORM in the Node.js project:
  npm install prisma --save-dev
  npm install @prisma/client
  npx prisma init

STEP 2: Database Configuration
- Configured Prisma to connect to my PostgreSQL database (todo_app) using DATABASE_URL in .env.

STEP 3: Model Definitions
- Defined User and Todo models with a one-to-many relationship.

STEP 4: Migration
- Ran migration with: npx prisma migrate dev --name init

STEP 5: Seeding
- Added seed script (prisma/seed.js) and populated the database with two users and three todos for each.

STEP 6: Verification
- Verified tables and data using Prisma Studio: npx prisma studio

Issues Encountered:
- None. The ORM connected successfully and created the tables as expected.
