## Task 8: Fetch ToDos from API

**Description:**  
Use `useEffect` to fetch todos from an API endpoint (e.g., `/api/todos`) when the component mounts and display them. The component should handle loading states and display fetched data.

**Requirements:**
- Use `useEffect` hook to fetch data on component mount
- Use `useState` to manage todos and loading state
- Fetch data from a mock API endpoint
- Display fetched todos in a list format
- Handle loading state appropriately
- Export the component as `export const FetchToDos`
- Use proper error handling for API calls

**Example:**
```jsx
// On mount, fetch and display todos from /api/todos
```

**Theoretical Questions:**
1. What is the useEffect hook and when should you use it?
2. How do you handle async operations in useEffect?
3. What is the difference between useEffect and useState hooks?
