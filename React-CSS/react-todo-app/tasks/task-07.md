## Task 7: Style Completed ToDo with CSS Module

**Description:**  
Use CSS Modules to style completed todos with a special class (e.g., strikethrough or color). The component should apply different styles based on the completion status.

**Requirements:**
- Accept a `todo` prop with `id`, `title`, and `completed` properties
- Import CSS module styles from `./CompletedTodo.module.css`
- Apply conditional styling based on `completed` status
- Use CSS module classes for styling
- Display the todo title with appropriate styling
- Export the component as `export const StyledToDoItem`
- Handle both completed and uncompleted todos with different styles

**Example:**
```jsx
// Completed todos have a different style
```

**Theoretical Questions:**
1. What are CSS Modules and how do they work in React?
2. How do you import and use CSS module classes in React components?
3. What are the benefits of using CSS Modules over regular CSS?
