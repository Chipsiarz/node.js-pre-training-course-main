# Task 07: Orchestrating Multiple Services with Docker Compose

Learn to manage multi-container applications using Docker Compose.

## Step-by-step Instructions

1. **Create a simple Node.js API:**
   - Create basic Express app (Node.js 24.x) with one GET endpoint `/health` that returns JSON status
   - Create endpoint `/data` that returns hardcoded JSON array
   - Create Dockerfile for this app

2. **Create Docker Compose with database:**
   - Add PostgreSQL service using `postgres:16` image
   - Add pgAdmin service using `dpage/pgadmin4` image for database management
   - Configure environment variables for database connection
   - Set up proper networking between services
   - Add volume for PostgreSQL data persistence

3. **Test the multi-service setup:**
   - Start all services with `docker-compose up`
   - Access your Node.js API endpoints
   - Access pgAdmin interface in browser
   - Connect pgAdmin to PostgreSQL service
   - Check service logs individually
   - Stop services gracefully

## Document Your Work
Create `solutions/task-07.txt` with:
- Complete `docker-compose.yml` file
- All Docker Compose commands used
- URLs and credentials for accessing services
- Output of `docker-compose ps` when services are running
