# Task 08: Simulating Team Git Workflow with Multiple Remotes

Practice a realistic Git workflow that simulates working with pull requests and code reviews.

## Step-by-step Instructions

1. **Set up remote simulation:**
   - Create a "main" repository (simulate company repo)
   - Create a "fork" repository (simulate your fork)
   - Set up both as remotes in your local repository

2. **Implement feature branch workflow:**
   - Create feature branch for a new functionality
   - Make several commits with good commit messages
   - Push feature branch to your "fork"
   - Create a pull request simulation by merging to main repo

3. **Handle feedback simulation:**
   - Make additional commits to address "review comments"
   - Practice force-pushing safely with `--force-with-lease`
   - Synchronize your fork with upstream changes

## Document Your Work
Create `solutions/task-08.txt` with:
- Remote configuration (`git remote -v`)
- Feature branch workflow commands
- Strategy for handling upstream changes
- Best practices for commit messages you learned
