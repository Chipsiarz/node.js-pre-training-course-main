# Task 10: Advanced Docker Networking and Data Persistence

Master Docker networking concepts and volume management for real-world applications.

## Step-by-step Instructions

1. **Custom Network Creation and Management:**
   - Create custom bridge network called `app-network`
   - Create custom network with specific subnet configuration
   - List and inspect network configurations
   - Test connectivity between containers on same network

2. **Multi-container Communication:**
   - Run MongoDB container on custom network with named volume
   - Run Mongo Express (web interface) on same network
   - Run simple Node.js app that connects to MongoDB by service name
   - Test that all services can communicate properly

3. **Volume Types and Data Persistence:**
   - Create named volume for database data
   - Use bind mount to share code during development
   - Create tmpfs mount for temporary data
   - Test data persistence by stopping/starting containers

4. **Network Isolation Testing:**
   - Create two separate networks
   - Run containers on different networks
   - Demonstrate isolation between networks
   - Connect container to multiple networks

## Document Your Work
Create `solutions/task-10.txt` with:
- All network and volume commands used
- Network topology diagram (text-based)
- Output of `docker network ls` and `docker volume ls`
- Test results showing container communication
- Explanation of different volume types used
