# Task 03: Create and Run Your First Docker Container

Introduction to Docker by creating and running a simple Node.js application in a container.

## Step-by-step Instructions

1. **Create a simple Node.js application:**
   - Create `app.js` with a basic HTTP server that responds "Hello Docker!" on port 3000
   - Create `package.json` with Node.js 24.x specified

2. **Create your first Dockerfile:**
   - Use `node:24-alpine` as base image
   - Set working directory to `/app`
   - Copy package files and install dependencies
   - Copy application code
   - Expose port 3000
   - Define CMD to start the application

3. **Build and run your container:**
   - Build Docker image with tag `my-node-app:v1`
   - Run container in detached mode mapping port 3000
   - List running containers and inspect your container
   - Test that your application responds correctly
   - View container logs
   - Stop and remove the container

## Document Your Work
Create `solutions/task-03.txt` with:
- Content of your Dockerfile
- All Docker commands used
- Output of `docker images`, `docker ps`, and `docker inspect`
- Response from your app (curl or browser test)
