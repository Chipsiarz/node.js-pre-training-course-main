# Task 06: Git Rebase and Clean History Management

Master advanced Git operations for maintaining clean project history.

## Step-by-step Instructions

1. **Create feature branch with multiple commits:**
   - Create branch `feature/user-authentication`
   - Make 4 separate small commits (add auth.js, update package.json, add middleware, add tests)
   - Include one "fix typo" commit in the middle

2. **Practice interactive rebase:**
   - Use interactive rebase to squash the typo fix into the previous commit
   - Reorder commits if needed
   - Edit commit messages to be more descriptive

3. **Rebase onto main:**
   - Make a commit on `main` branch (simulate other developer's work)
   - Rebase your feature branch onto the updated main
   - Compare with merge approach using a separate test branch

## Document Your Work
Create `solutions/task-06.txt` with:
- Commands used for interactive rebase
- Before/after commit history (`git log --oneline`)
- Explanation of when to use rebase vs merge
- Any challenges you encountered
