# Task 01: Initialize Repository and Basic Git Operations

In this task, you will learn the fundamental Git operations by creating a new repository from scratch and making your first commits.

## Step-by-step Instructions

1. **Initialize a new Git repository:**
   - Create a new directory called `my-first-repo`
   - Initialize it as a Git repository
   - Configure your name and email for this repository

2. **Create initial files:**
   - Create a `README.md` file with project description
   - Create a `.gitignore` file that ignores `node_modules/`, `.env`, and `*.log` files
   - Create a simple `package.json` file with basic project information

3. **Make your first commits:**
   - Stage and commit the `.gitignore` file first
   - Stage and commit `README.md` and `package.json` together
   - Check your commit history

## Document Your Work
Create `solutions/task-01.txt` with:
- All Git commands you used
- Output of `git log --oneline`
- Brief explanation of what each command does
