# Task 02: Creating Branches and Basic Merge Operations

Learn how to work with Git branches, which is essential for collaborative development.

## Step-by-step Instructions

1. **Create and work with branches:**
   - Create a new branch called `feature/add-scripts`
   - Switch to this branch
   - Add a `scripts` section to your `package.json` with `start`, `test`, and `dev` scripts

2. **Make changes and switch between branches:**
   - Commit your changes on the feature branch
   - Switch back to `main` branch and observe the differences
   - Create another branch called `feature/add-dependencies` from `main`

3. **Merge your work:**
   - Switch to `main` branch
   - Merge the `feature/add-scripts` branch
   - Delete the merged branch
   - Check your branch list and commit history

## Document Your Work
Create `solutions/task-02.txt` with:
- All Git commands used
- Output of `git branch -a` at different stages
- Screenshot or text output of `git log --graph --oneline`
